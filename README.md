# Iris-Flowers-Classification-Project
A well-known data set that contains 150 records of three species of Iris flowers Iris Setosa,
Iris Virginica, and Iris Versicolor. There are 50 records for each Iris species and every record
contains four features, the petal length, and width, the sepal length and width. I used a kNearest Neighbors algorithm to classify these species based on these four features. The input
was the dataset which is in the ”sklearn” library and the new Iris flower which I wanted to
predict. It was a classification problem. Therefore, it returned the class of the given iris flower.
I did it to explore the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN).
