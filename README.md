# Iris-Flowers-Classification-Project
A well known data set that contains 150 records of three species of Iris flowers Iris Setosa , Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. There are 50 records for each Iris species and every record contains four features, the pedal length and width, the sepal length and width. We are going to use a k-Nearest neighbors algorithm to classify these species based on these four features.
